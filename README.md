Goals:
------

* Compile on GCC 4.4.7 with --std=c++0x
* No exceptions, so it can be run with -fno-except (is that how you spell it?)
* No RTTI, so can compile with -fno-rtti

Secondary Goals:
---------------



License:
--------

Pick one:

* Perl Artistic license. (i.e. use as you see fit, just give credit to me.)

* Email me to explain why, and I'll grant you a Public Domain license.
