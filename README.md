# http-cpp0x

Goals:
------

* Compile on GCC 4.4.7 with --std=c++0x
* No exceptions, so it can be run with -fno-except (is that how you spell it?)
* No RTTI, so can compile with -fno-rtti
* Single header file

Secondary Goals:
---------------

To make a single monolithic header:
-----------------------------------

Concatenate all the headers in the 'include' directory
